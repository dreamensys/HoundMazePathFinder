# HoundMazePathFinder

This is a simple implementation of an [A* Path Finding Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) wich is a standard way to solve mazes.

You can find further information about A* Algorithm in this [post](http://www.policyalmanac.org/games/aStarTutorial.htm) of Patrick Lester.

### How it works?
The program by default solves a maze built from a txt file located on the project, but you can find other examples right there in order to test the algorithm.

So, when the program is executed, you will be able to see the entire path(coordintes) from the start location to the end location solving the maze. Also, you will be able to see graphically the path on the console.
